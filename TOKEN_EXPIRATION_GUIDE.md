# YouTube Token Expiration - Achieving Full Autonomy 🚀

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Why Tokens Expire

YouTube refresh tokens expire if:
1. **App is in "Testing" mode** → Tokens expire after **7 days** ❌
2. **App is in "Production" mode** → Tokens **NEVER expire** ✅ (unless manually revoked)

## 🎯 Goal: Make It Truly Autonomous

To achieve 100% autonomous operation (5 videos daily forever):

### Step 1: Publish Your OAuth App to PRODUCTION

Your Google Cloud OAuth app must be in **PRODUCTION** mode (not testing):

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. Select your project
3. Click **"PUBLISH APP"** button (top right)
4. Review the warnings and click **"CONFIRM"**
5. Your app status should change to **"In production"**

**Once in production:**
- ✅ Refresh tokens NEVER expire automatically
- ✅ You can run autonomously for months/years
- ✅ Only expires if YOU manually revoke access

## 🔧 What To Do RIGHT NOW

### Option A: Quick Fix (Current Token Issue)

1. **In Replit Shell, run:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/auto_fix_token.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Browser opens automatically
   - Authorize and copy the code
   - Paste it in terminal
   - Token updates automatically

3. **Restart your app**

### Option B: Long-Term Solution (Enable Production Mode)

1. **Fix current token** (Option A above)
2. **Publish OAuth app to production** (see Step 1 above)
3. **That's it!** Your tokens will never expire automatically

---

## ✅ After Production Mode

Once your app is in production:
- ✅ Token never expires automatically
- ✅ System runs 100% autonomously
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Videos post daily forever

The auto-recovery system is just a **safety net** in case:
- You accidentally revoke access
- Google requires re-verification (rare)
- Something else unusual happens
