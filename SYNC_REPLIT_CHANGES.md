# How to Sync Replit Changes to GitHub

Replit made some fixes to `requirements.txt` that we need to sync back to GitHub.

## What Replit Changed:
- ✅ Removed built-in modules (smtplib, email, sqlite3) - these don't need to be in requirements.txt
- ✅ Likely added `numpy<2ゲーム` to fix OpenCV compatibility
- ✅ Cleaned up any duplicates

## Steps to Sync:

### In Replit Shell:

```bash
git status
```

This shows what files changed.

Then:

```bash
git add requirements.txt scheduler.py main.py
git commit -m "Add randomized posting times, manual trigger API, and sync Replit fixes"
git push origin main
```

**Or if you see more files that changed:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Sync all Replit improvements: randomized times, manual triggers, fixed requirements"
git push origin main
```

## Our Improvements (need to sync):

✅ **Randomized posting times** (scheduler.py) - prevents YouTube spam detection
✅ **Manual trigger API** (main.py) - POST /generate endpoint for testing
✅ **FastAPI web server** - for keep-alive and manual triggers

**After you push, tell me "done" and we'll continue with keep-alive setup!**
