# Complete Answers to Your Questions

## 1. ✅ Secrets Verification Script

**I created `verify_secrets.py`** - it tests each API automatically without showing the actual keys!

**Run in Replit Shell:**
```bash
python verify_secrets.py
```

It will show:
- ✅ or ❌ for each API
- If expired/invalid, it tells you
- No visual checking needed!

---

## 2. Expired Secrets Check ✅

**The script checks for expired tokens:**
- YouTube refresh token: Tests if it can refresh (tells you if expired)
- Groq: Tests with actual API call
- Reddit: Tests credentials

**If expired, it tells you exactly which one and what to do!**

---

## 3. Sync Status ✅

**Current status: ALL SYNCED!**

- ✅ Local ↔️ GitHub: Synced (we pushed)
- ✅ GitHub ↔️ Replit: Synced (we pulled)
- ✅ Replit fixes → GitHub: Synced (we pushed)

**After this session**, when you make changes:
1. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. In Replit: `git pull origin main`

**Everything stays in sync!**

## 4. Work Locally vs Replit?

**Recommendation: Keep working in Replit** because:
- ✅ Already configured with Secrets
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Easy to see logs
- ✅ Can test immediately

**But if you prefer local:**
- Test locally first
- Push to GitHub
- Pull in Replit
- Test again

**Both work!** I recommend Replit for now since it's already set up.
