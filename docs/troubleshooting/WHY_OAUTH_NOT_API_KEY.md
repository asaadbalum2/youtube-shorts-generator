# Why OAuth Instead of API Key?

## Short Answer
**OAuth 2.0 is required for uploading videos to YouTube.** API keys can only read public data.

## Detailed Explanation

### API Keys - Read Only
- ✅ Can search for videos
- ✅ Can get public video information
- ✅ Can read channel statistics
- ❌ **CANNOT upload videos**
- ❌ **CANNOT modify channel content**
- ❌ **CANNOT post videos**

### OAuth 2.0 - Full Access
- ✅ Can read everything API keys can
- ✅ **CAN upload videos** ← This is what we need!
- ✅ **CAN modify channel content**
- ✅ **CAN post to your channel**
- ✅ Secure - requires user authorization

## Why YouTube Requires OAuth for Uploads

1. **Security**: Uploading videos can modify your channel, so YouTube requires explicit user permission
2. **Access Control**: OAuth ensures only authorized apps can upload to your channel
3. **User Consent**: You must explicitly grant permission (that's the authorization step)
4. **Token Refresh**: OAuth provides refresh tokens that can be renewed automatically

## Bottom Line

For **reading** YouTube data → API Key is enough
For **uploading videos** → OAuth 2.0 is **required**

Since our goal is to **automatically upload 5 videos daily**, we **must** use OAuth 2.0.

## Your Current Setup

You now have:
- ✅ New Web application OAuth client
- ✅ Client ID and Secret in Replit Secrets
- ✅ Redirect URI configured (`http://localhost:8080`)

**Next step**: Generate the refresh token!
