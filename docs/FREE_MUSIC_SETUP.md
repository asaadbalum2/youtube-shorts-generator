## ✅ Step 2: Organize Music Files

1. In your Replit project, make sure this folder exists:
   ```
   assets/music/
   ```

2. Create subfolders for each style:
   ```
   assets/music/upbeat/
   assets/music/dramatic/
   assets/music/ambient/
   assets/music/minimalist/
   assets/music/cinematic/
   assets/music/suspenseful/
   assets/music/inspiring/
   ```

3. Upload the music files you downloaded:
   - Go to Replit file explorer
   - Navigate to `assets/music/upbeat/`
   - Click **"Upload"** button
   - Select your downloaded upbeat music files
   - Repeat for other folders

## ✅ Step 3: That's It!

The system will automatically:
- Search for music in the appropriate style folder
- Randomly select one for each video
- Mix it with voiceover at correct volume (15%)
- Loop it if the video is longer than the music

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- **Download 5-10 tracks per style** so you have variety
- **Keep file sizes reasonable** (< 5MB per file is good)
- **Name files descriptively** (e.g., "upbeat_track_1.mp3")
- **YouTube Audio Library updates regularly** - check back monthly for new tracks
