# Where Do I Install Dependencies? 📦

## Short Answer:

**YOU DON'T!** 

Dependencies are installed **automatically on your hosting platform** when you deploy.

---

## Detailed Explanation:

### If Deploying to Hosting (Recommended) ✅

| Platform | Where Dependencies Install | What You Do |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Railway** | Automatically on their servers during deployment | Nothing! Just push code |
| **Replit** | Automatically when you run the code | Nothing! Just click "Run" |
| **Render** | Automatically during build process | Nothing! Just configure and deploy |
| **Oracle Cloud VPS** | On the VPS server (via SSH) | Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` once via SSH |

**You never run `pip install` on your computer when deploying!**

### If Testing Locally (Optional) 💻

Only if you want to test before deploying:

1. **On your computer:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs all Python packages to your local machine.

2. **Where?** In the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd YShortsGen
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Why?** To test that everything works before deploying.

## The Flow:

### Deployment Flow (No Local Install):
```
You → Upload code to GitHub/hosting → Hosting platform reads requirements.txt 
→ Hosting platform runs "pip install -r requirements.txt" automatically 
→ Your app starts running
```

### Local Testing Flow:
```
You → Install Python locally → Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
→ Test locally → Then deploy to hosting
```

## What Gets Installed?

The `requirements.txt` file lists all dependencies. Hosting platforms read this and install:
- FastAPI
- Groq (AI)
- MoviePy (video editing)
- FFmpeg (video processing)
- All other packages

You don't need to manually install any of these!

## Common Confusion:

❌ **"Do I run pip install on my computer?"**
→ No, if deploying to hosting.

❌ **"Where is pip install run?"**
→ On the hosting platform's server, automatically.

✅ **"Do I need Python on my computer?"**
→ No, if deploying to hosting. Only if testing locally.

✅ **"When do dependencies install?"**
→ Automatically when you deploy to hosting.

---

## Summary:

**For Hosting Deployment:**
- ✅ Get API keys (in your browser)
- ✅ Upload code to GitHub/hosting
- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ **Dependencies install automatically - you do nothing!**

**For Local Testing:**
- ✅ Install Python 3.8+ on your computer
- ✅ Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in project folder
- ✅ Test locally
- ✅ Then deploy (dependencies install automatically on hosting too)

---

**Bottom line:** If you're deploying to hosting, skip all local installation steps! 🚀
