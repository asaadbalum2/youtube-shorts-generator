# Replit Web Service Configuration

## The Issue:
Your FastAPI server is running on port 8080, but Replit isn't exposing it publicly to the internet.

## Solution:

### Method 1: Use Replit's Built-in Preview (Easiest)

1. **In Replit, click the "Preview" button/tab** (top right)
2. Click **"Open in new tab"** or look for the webview
3. Replit should automatically detect port 8080 and create a preview
4. You'll see your dashboard there!

### Method 2: Check Replit Webview URL

1. After starting your app, look for a URL in the Replit interface
2. It might be something like: `https://youtube-shorts-generator.asaadbalum2.repl.co`
3. Try accessing: `https://youtube-shorts-generator.asaadbalum2.repl.co/dashboard/`

### Method 3: Configure Replit Always-On Web Service

If you have Replit Hacker plan (free for students):
1. In Replit sidebar, look for "Tools" → "Always On"
2. Enable it
3. Replit will expose your web service automatically

### Method 4: Use Replit's Web Service Feature

1. In Replit, look for "Tools" → "Packager" or "Webview"
2. Make sure it's configured to show web content
3. The Preview pane should show your dashboard

## Quick Test:

**In Replit Shell, after pulling the latest code:**
```bash
git pull origin main
# Restart the app
```

**Then in Replit:**
- Click the **"Preview"** tab (should be in the right panel)
- If it shows "The app is currently not running", click the **play button**
- Wait for it to load - you should see the dashboard!

**The key:** Use Replit's Preview pane instead of trying to access it via external URL. Replit's Preview automatically proxies to your local port!
