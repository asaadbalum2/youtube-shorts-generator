## ✅ Problem Solved!

You're right - **static downloads won't give you trending/viral tracks**. Here's the solution:

## 🎯 Solution: **Jamendo API** - Automatic Trending Music

### How It Works:

1. **Jamendo updates trending tracks WEEKLY** using their `popularity_week` order
2. **No manual downloads** - tracks are fetched automatically via API
3. **Copyright-safe** - all tracks are Creative Commons licensed
4. **Always fresh** - each week Jamendo updates what's trending

### What Changed:

**✅ IMPLEMENTED:** Jamendo is now **FIRST PRIORITY** (not YouTube Audio Library)

The system now:
- ✅ Fetches **trending tracks automatically** (no downloads needed)
- ✅ Uses `popularity_week` order (updated weekly by Jamendo)
- ✅ Prioritizes recent tracks (2024-2025) for viral content
- ✅ Picks from top 5 trending tracks for variety

---

## 🔄 How Trending Works:

### Jamendo API:
```python
order: 'popularity_week'  # Gets tracks trending THIS WEEK
boost: 'popularity_total'  # Also considers all-time popularity
datebetween: '2024-01-01_2025-12-31'  # Prefer recent tracks
```

**Result:** You get tracks that are:
- ✅ Trending **right now** (this week)
- ✅ Popular (high engagement)
- ✅ Recent (viral potential)
- ✅ Copyright-safe (Creative Commons)

---

## 📋 Setup (Already Done for You):

Just add your Jamendo credentials to Replit Secrets:
